CODEX Here is my intention. I will talk w/ gpt through the current interactions. ask we discuss, the task will get refined and so will the planning. When we execute, which we will plan to do later, it will execute the established plan for the tasks. We will want to use ChatCompletions where the system and assistant will have different responsibilities each interaction. 
Plan = overall, start to finish, steps our gpt coordinator will run. This will include the tasks, in sequence, as well as(per task) the context, snippets, external links, repo, highlighted files, etc. A plan will also define the # of iterations a task will require to complete output. This will have the overall project contexts for all tasks if more context desired.
Task = individual task. minimum of 1, max 5. A task starts with a task goal. The task goal is something the system will refine each iteraction as the tasks goals become more clear. A goal isnt something the user just tells GPT, a goal is something GPT and the user work out until there is a mutual understanding of the goal, then we proceed. knowing the goal, now GPT will want to know 1. related files 2. code snippets the user wants to provide(these get higher priority) 3. specific instructions. With that, GPT would then present a list of  methods(and classes but only if new class) (not the code itself) filled with notes of method contents.  Use and GPT review goal and the class/method summary, iterate as user needs to refine task. User can either then create another task, or finalize plan.
Once tasks finalized, plan is finalized with GPT asking any additional required details, then dispatching ada to comb redis memory for context. Plan and final context provided to user, who then will execute plan to output files to folder/give. This will require more than just the two classes but first just update the two classes with all i said in mind.
